Config Driven UI
- A config-driven UI (User Interface) refers to a design approach where the UI is generated dynamically based on a predefined configuration. This configuration is typically structured in a format such as JSON, XML, or YAML and dictates various aspects of the UI such as layout, components, styles, and behaviors.

Two types of export/import
- Default Export/import
		- export default Component;
		- import Component from "path";

-Named Export/import
		- export const Component;
		- import {Component} from "path";

//React Hooks
- Normal js utility functions

// useState()
 => used to create superpowerful state variable in react
 => Whenever a state variable changes/updates, react will re-render the component
 => Do not use useState hook inside the conditional statements/loops/functions or outside of the component

// How React works
- Reconciliation Algorithm(ReactFiber)
- Uses virtual DOM => is a representation of an actual DOM
- React Component is an object which represents a virtual DOM

// useEffect
=> This hook will be called as soon as the component is rendered completely
=> Two arguments -> callback function and dependency array(optional)
=> If no dependency array -> useEffect is called on every render of the component
=> If dependency array is empty = [] -> useEffect is called on initial render only (just once when the component is rendered for the first time)
=> If dependency array is not empty like [btnName], useEffect will be called evertime btnName updates/changes

=> The component is re-rendered everytime whenever a state variable changes
=> Whenever state variables update, react triggers a reconciliation cycle(re-renders the component)

=> rafce -> creates a boilerplate component

# Two types of routing in web apps
=> Client side routing
=> Server side routing
